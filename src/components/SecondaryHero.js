                Call us crazy, but we believe being a product of out environment
                can be a good thing. At our headquarters in Springfield, MO, our
                collaborative spaces flow one into the next. The open airy feel
                keep our heads in the game. The natural light gives us our munch
                needed daily dose of Vitamin D. And we're so obsessed with writing
                on whiteboards that a few of them have gone mobile.
