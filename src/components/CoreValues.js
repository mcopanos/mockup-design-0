                    Our core values are essentially our own
                    North Stars. They're the root cause of
                    our wins and what we look to for guidance
                    when we're challenged the most. They push
                    us forward and upward, lead us safely away
                    from missteps, and reminds us why we dou what
                    we do. We think every team should stand for
                    something-why not six things?
